# Project Notes: Async Implementation for Trading Algorithm
# 2/5/24
## Key Decision
Employing async/await in your trading algorithm is recommended to handle multiple asset streaming and concurrent order placement efficiently.

## Refactoring Steps

### Make start_websocket_stream asynchronous
1. Utilize `async def` declaration.
2. Initialize BinanceSocketManager asynchronously using `async with`.
3. Spawn concurrent tasks for each asset stream with `asyncio.create_task`.
4. Wait for all tasks to complete with `asyncio.gather`.

### Make handle_socket_message asynchronous
1. Use `async for` to iterate through stream messages.
2. Call your trade calculator logic asynchronously (`place_order`) upon a trade decision.

### Implement asynchronous order placement
1. Use an async-compatible Binance API client (e.g., aiohttp-binance) with `async with`.
2. Place market orders asynchronously using `await client.create_order`.

## Additional Notes
- Thoroughly test your modified code due to the complexities of asynchronous programming.
- Implement error handling and rate limiting for a robust trading system.
- Continuously evaluate your strategy and performance metrics for adjustments.
